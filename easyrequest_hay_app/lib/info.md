### Under Construction

This easyrequest-hay service helps users get the items they need which are managed by Brown's special-collections Libray, the [John Hay Library](https://library.brown.edu/hay/).

Here's a typical flow...

- You'll start in [Josiah](https://search.library.brown.edu), the Brown-Library catalog.

- You'll do a search on Thomas Jefferson, and eventually find an item you want to look at, published in 1897: [The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b2994396).

    - Because of its age, this book is managed by Brown's special-collections Library, the John Hay Library. Special-collections materials may only be used in this building.

- You'll see that the 'Status' is 'Available', and to the right is the link 'request-access' _(again, under-construction, not-yet-available)_. Clicking that link gets you to this easyrequest-hay service.

- After logging in, you'll land at a web-page where you can provide the Special-Collections staff with additional information about what you need (you won't have to re-type information about the item you want).

    - If it's your very first time landing at that additional-information page, you'll be asked to create an account in that software, and then you'll land at the additional-information page.

If you have questions, the Hay staff can help you. More information can be found at our [Special Collections help page](https://library.brown.edu/hay/specol.php), where you can also find staff contact information.
